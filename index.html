    <h2>why do i like them?</h2>
     <p>For SZA, her music is known for its emotional depth, introspective lyrics, and ethereal, melodic delivery. Her song is explore the complexities of love, heartbreak and vulnerability. I legit think that woman has not gotten over that nigga that broke up with her after 11 years of being together, damn.</p>
     <p>Oh, Tory Lanez will always have my heart.He is one versatile artist i don't about and his versatility makes him unique. He's too good, too bad he is in jail rn.#freetory# </p> 
     <p>PND's music is like sunset to me...so beautiful. I cannot wait to go to that nigga's concert, imma scream my lungs out trust. His music often feels like a late night vibe where you just wanna chill and feel the mood.</p>
